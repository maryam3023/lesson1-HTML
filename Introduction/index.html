    <h1> Hello my name is Maryam </h1>
    <p> I am from Canada I use to work in tech support, but over time I found a real interest in coding and decided to make the switch to software development.<br />
        I’m currently learning full-stack development and picking up new skills with every project.<br />
        Outside of tech, I spend my free time learning Arabic, seeking knowledge, baking and selling sweet goods.<br />
        This portfolio is where I share what I’ve been building. I hope to share more about myself through my work.
