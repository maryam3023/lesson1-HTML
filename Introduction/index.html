    <h1> Hello my name is Maryam </h1>
    <p> I am from Canada I use to work in tech support, but over time I found a real interest in coding and decided to make the switch to software development. I’m currently learning full-stack development and picking up new skills with every project. Outside of tech, I’m learning Arabic, seeking knowledge and spending my free time baking and selling sweet goods. This portfolio is where I share what I’ve been building. </p>
    <span> And thats a bit about me </span>
